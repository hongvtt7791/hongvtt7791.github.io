Needless to mention a strange COVID era that we all are living in that pulls everyone away from each other like the way gravity forces you to become more down to earth.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now my world view is squeezed and downsizing to the point that it only covers 1km radius from where I live.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My focus too is going inward, which is a purely good thing people say, that forces me to corner my own self every day and shower it with head-aches questions.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>So, what do you want to do today? You don\u2019t know? How come you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re gonna do?<\/li><li>OK let me fix that. Hmm. Let\u2019s start with the things that you like. What is that? Quick quick! Give it to me<\/li><li>You don\u2019t know too? OMG! How about things that you don\u2019t like. Things that make you feel angry and bored so we can get rid of that.<\/li><li>You don\u2019t\u2026? NO, no, don\u2019t say that.<\/li><li>Let me help you. You don\u2019t like this machine and that furniture and this stuff and all of those kinds of stuff over there.<\/li><li>They are like the pains in your eyes.<\/li><li>So let them go! Replace them with things that you really want to have. Things that just click.<\/li><li>Things that you want to have just because you know exactly how they would make your life better and easier, instead of how affordable they are at the time.<\/li><li>Yes! Of course! Go surround yourself with and only with things you love. You only live once, remember?<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s stop here. I might go a bit too far from my point. What was my point again? Ah, competition, right right.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>From time to time, when you own something that makes you feel good, you desire to share with others, to show them how happy you are, how beautiful those pieces of art that you had deliberately picked up. And most importantly, to show them subtlety how sophisticated your style is, and what an enjoyable life you have.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, believe me, that\u2019s what neighbors are here for.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now let\u2019s think again when you are the one who is invited to see others&#8217; houses.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Wow, they do know how to live their life!<\/li><li>Where did you buy it? Amazon? Great! I\u2019ll get a pair for myself. Cannot resist it!<\/li><li>\u2026Wait a minute, I do like it very much so I bought it. But why now I\u2019m feeling like I\u2019m just catching up?&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, smell the tension up in the air now?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Starting as an idea of self-loving and caring, now it doesn\u2019t feel as good, does it?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe instead of busting myself to reach the infinity goal with others, I just need to stop and walk at my own pace on my own line.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let just stop the mental madness of social comparison.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because for any single competition that you think you are on, if you don\u2019t start at the same time with others and you don\u2019t even know where and when this will end, then it is not even a fair competition.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If so, why even bother to compete in the first place?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What are our competitions going up?
